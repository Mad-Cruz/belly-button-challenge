# Belly Button Challenge
## Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species, also called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Assignment Steps

Step 1: Data Retrieval
Use the D3 library to read in the dataset from the following URL: Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset.

Step 2: 
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in each individual.


Step 3: 
Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Step 4: 
Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
